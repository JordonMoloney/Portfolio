This first link is to one of the bigger projects from my Web Authouring course. The assignment was to create / design a pizza company, then program a website for it using html, php, css. I got 100% on the assignment for going above and beyond since, I designed, photoshopped elements for the website (background pictures), added more features, and did way beyond the expectations for the visuals using css:   https://dirtydangles.azurewebsites.net
This second link is for the next large assignment which we had to make a website for a movie (using html, php, and css),  based off the style of the poster. I recieved a grade of 100% for outstanding work with the css. Although we only had to make the one page for the poster I decided to make a home page, a link for the actual trailer youtube video, and the main poster. I did that simply because I wanted the final product to look better (depending on your download speed, the page might need to be refreshed since there's a lot of elements to load in) : https://tron-jordon.azurewebsites.net/
This third link is to my final project for this web authouring class. We had to make a website where you could go to buy a product from the early 20th century as if the internet had existed back then. I did mine on the Lee Enfield Rifle as I am a bit of history buff. Like the previous 2 above, I also got 100% on this final project. Mainly since the css & php work I did was far beyond the expectations for the assignment: https://rsaf.azurewebsites.net/
